# Deep Weeds Classification
- Experimenting with various neural network architectures for computer vision classification.
- The dataset is the Deep Weeds dataset from Tensorflow, classifying variants of weeds (including a negative class) from images.
- Modelling includes a simple CNN, ResNet from scratch, and ViT Transformer from scratch (PyTorch).
- RayTune and Optuna setup for model experiment running.
